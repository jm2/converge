// run on every convergence. For such a resource, Check reporting drift again
// immediately after a successful Apply is its correct contract, not a failure,
// so the engine skips the post-Apply convergence re-Check when this returns true.
// (Adding an idempotency guard makes the resource convergent again, so the value
// is evaluated per instance rather than per type.)

// Condition is optionally set on Meta to gate convergence on system

// initial convergence. Conditions do not affect ongoing drift detection after
// they are first satisfied.

// Implementations must use OS-native APIs (netlink, inotify, Win32, etc.).

// API exists for the condition type (documented per implementation).
